Version of D Star Implementation in Java, created for Dr. Kay's Advanced Robotics class @ Rowan University in December 2014.   

Contains a Java implementation of the D* algorithm. Included in the src files is a map (map.txt) that can be adjusted to any configuration. The code in this project is based on the algorithm as presented by Anthony Stentz in the paper "(Optimal and Efficient Path Planning for Partially-Known Environments)[http://www.ri.cmu.edu/publication_view.html?pub_id=1215]".
